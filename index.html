                <br>
                <p>A video game or computer game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user
                    interface or input device (such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing device) to
                    generate visual feedback from a display device, most commonly shown in a video format on a
                    television set, computer monitor, flat-panel display or touchscreen on handheld devices, or a
                    virtual reality headset. Most modern video games are audiovisual, with audio complement delivered
                    through speakers or headphones, and sometimes also with other types of sensory feedback (e.g.,
                    haptic technology that provides tactile sensations), and some video games also allow microphone and
                    webcam inputs for in-game chatting and livestreaming.

                    Video games are typically categorized according to their hardware platform, which traditionally
                    includes arcade video games, console games, and computer (PC) games; the latter also encompasses LAN
                    games, online games, and browser games. More recently, the video game industry has expanded onto
                    mobile gaming through mobile devices (such as smartphones and tablet computers), virtual and
                    augmented reality systems, and remote cloud gaming. Video games are also classified into a wide
                    range of genres based on their style of gameplay and target audience.</p>

                <h3 style="text-align: center;">History</h3>
                <br>
                <p>The early history of the video game industry, following the first game hardware releases and through
                    1983, had little structure. Video games quickly took off during the golden age of arcade video games
                    from the late 1970s to early 1980s, but the newfound industry was mainly composed of game developers
                    with little business experience. This led to numerous companies forming simply to create clones of
                    popular games to try to capitalize on the market. Due to loss of publishing control and
                    oversaturation of the market, the North American home video game market crashed in 1983, dropping
                    from revenues of around $3 billion in 1983 to $100 million by 1985. Many of the North American
                    companies created in the prior years closed down. Japan's growing game industry was briefly shocked
                    by this crash but had sufficient longevity to withstand the short-term effects, and Nintendo helped
                    to revitalize the industry with the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America in
                    1985. Along with it, Nintendo established a number of core industrial practices to prevent
                    unlicensed game development and control game distribution on their platform, methods that continue
                    to be used by console manufacturers today.</p>
